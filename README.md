Branch with backend project realized with Java Spring Boot framework.

We use spring 2.7.6 and java 11 in this project, the database is managed by springData JPA and we use a MySql database to store our data.
In this project we made a feww simple REST end point, all of these use GET http method.
The backend have also a part that comunicate with pyhon REST end point but is still a work in progress today.

As you can see in the picture we have implemented the open-api spring boot library to make eaesier to consume our rest end point

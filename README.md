# InfoSense
Branch with backend project realized with Java Spring Boot framework.

We use spring 2.7.6 and java 11 in this project, the database is managed by springData JPA and we use a MySql database to store our data.
In this project we made a few simple REST end point, all of these use GET http method in order to produce tourism statistics chart.
Our goal is to cover all controller with junit test.
The backend have also a part that comunicate with pyhon REST end point but is still a work in progress today.

As you can see in the picture we have implemented the open-api spring boot library to make eaesier to consume our rest end point
